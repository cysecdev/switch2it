# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Labs Repository

Welcome to my Cyber Labs journal! This repository is created to document my learning and hands-on practice in Blue Team and Red Team skills using:

- [Let's Defend](https://letsdefend.io) for SOC Level 1 incident response simulations
- [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) for cybersecurity labs (Blue/Red Team)
